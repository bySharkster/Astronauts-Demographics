<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Abstract
This exploratory research is the final product of the hands-on workshops offered by the Institute of Data Sciences at the Inter-American University of Puerto Rico during the 2021 Summer Session. It includes a statistical and descriptive analysis of a dataset that incorporates demographical and operational characteristics of 1,278 space flights that were carried out during the 1959 to 2018 period.  The goal of this study was to discover, through the use of the R Studio software, how changes in the strategic direction of the space programs had an impact in the operational and demographic characteristics of the space flights missions. This endeavor required the application of the Dplyr and Ggplot2 packages for data exploration and visualization. The findings of this research indicates that, in the early 1980s, there were major changes in the inclusion of women and other minority groups in these spaceflights. Similarly, we found strong evidence that confirms the advancement of the astronaut selection programs in achieving a certain degree of ethnic, professional, national and gender diversification. Finally, it was possible to verify, how change in the strategic direction of the space programs (from a militaristic to a scientific scope) had an impact in the duration of extravehicular activities and of space flights.
